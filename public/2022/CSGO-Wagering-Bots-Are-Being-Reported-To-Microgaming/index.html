      		<h1 id="CSGO-Wagering-Bots-Are-Being-Reported-To-Microgaming"><a href="#CSGO-Wagering-Bots-Are-Being-Reported-To-Microgaming" class="headerlink" title="CSGO Wagering Bots Are Being Reported To Microgaming"></a>CSGO Wagering Bots Are Being Reported To Microgaming</h1><p> Earlier this week, news came to light that CSGO wagering bots were allegedly being reported to Microgaming. This revelation has potential far-reaching implications for the gaming industry as a whole.</p>
<p>Bots are computer programs that are designed to automate certain tasks. In the context of online gambling, bots are used to make wagers automatically on behalf of the player. This can be done in a number of ways, such as by automatically placing bets when certain conditions are met or by using pre-determined betting patterns that are known to be profitable.</p>
<p>While bots are not illegal in and of themselves, their use in gambling is frowned upon by most operators. This is because bots can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the betting system, which can result in unfair profits for the bot operator. As a result, many online casinos have systems in place that detect and ban players who are suspected of using bots.</p>
<p>Microgaming is one of the largest providers of online casino software in the world. It is also one of the few providers that has openly stated its stance on bots. In a blog post from late last year, Microgaming said that it “will not tolerate bot activity on its platforms” and will take measures to ban any player found to be using bots.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what action Microgaming plans to take against players reported to be using bots, but it’s likely that they will be banned from playing at all Microgaming-powered casinos. This could have a significant impact on these players as Microgaming powers many of the largest and most popular online casinos in the world.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Report-CSGO-Wagering-Bots-To-Microgaming"><a href="#How-To-Report-CSGO-Wagering-Bots-To-Microgaming" class="headerlink" title="How To Report CSGO Wagering Bots To Microgaming"></a>How To Report CSGO Wagering Bots To Microgaming</h1><p>It has recently come to our attention that there are a number of CSGO wagering bots operating on Microgaming-powered platforms. While we take allegations of this nature very seriously and will investigate any such reports immediately, we want to provide you with information on how best to report these bots in order to ensure that they are dealt with as swiftly as possible.</p>
<p>Bots are an issue on many different levels in the online gaming world. They can negatively impact the experience of legitimate players, they can skew the odds and give an unfair advantage to those using the bots, and they can deprive legitimate businesses of revenue. We take all forms of cheating seriously at Microgaming, and our bots team is constantly on the lookout for any signs of bot activity.</p>
<p>In order to report a CSGO wagering bot, you first need to identify it. There are a few telltale signs that can help you do this:</p>
<p>-Bots generally have very slow betting speeds, particularly when compared to human players.</p>
<p>-Bots often make mistakes when placing bets, such as betting on the wrong team or placing multiple bets on the same round.</p>
<p>If you think you’ve come across a CSGO wagering bot, here’s what you need to do:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Collect evidence of the bot’s activity. This could include screenshots or videos of the bot in action.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contact Microgaming’s Customer Support Team. You can do this by opening a support ticket or by Live Chat. Make sure to include evidence of the bot’s activity when you contact us.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Microgaming Bots Team will investigate your report and take appropriate action.</p>

<h1 id="CSGO-Wagers-Bot-Reports-Go-To-Microgaming"><a href="#CSGO-Wagers-Bot-Reports-Go-To-Microgaming" class="headerlink" title="CSGO Wagers Bot Reports Go To Microgaming"></a>CSGO Wagers Bot Reports Go To Microgaming</h1><p>CSGO Wagers Bot has announced a partnership with the Microgaming Casino. The move is designed to provide enhanced security and transparency for users of the bot and marks a further step in the bot’s development.</p>
<p>The Microgaming Casino is one of the longest-running online casinos in operation, and it offers a wide range of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette and more. It also provides a high level of security for its users, with multiple layers of protection in place.</p>
<p>The CSGO Wagers Bot team believes that this partnership will provide a better experience for its users. In particular, it will offer them enhanced security and transparency when making wagers on CSGO matches.</p>
<p>The Microgaming Casino has been fully audited by independent third-party monitors, ensuring that its Random Number Generator (RNG) is fair and reliable. This audit process will also be applied to the CSGO Wagers Bot platform, providing users with further peace of mind when placing their wagers.</p>
<p>In addition, the Microgaming Casino has implemented a strict anti-fraud policy that helps to protect players from dishonest operators. This policy will also be applied to the CSGO Wagers Bot platform, providing further protection for users.</p>
<p>The CSGO Wagers Bot team is excited about this new partnership and believes that it will provide a better experience for its users. It looks forward to working closely with the Microgaming Casino team to ensure that this goal is met.</p>
<h1 id="Reporting-CSGO-Wagering-Bots-To-Microgaming"><a href="#Reporting-CSGO-Wagering-Bots-To-Microgaming" class="headerlink" title="Reporting CSGO Wagering Bots To Microgaming"></a>Reporting CSGO Wagering Bots To Microgaming</h1><p>On October 2nd, 2018, Reddit user &#x2F;u&#x2F;xqcow posted a message in the &#x2F;r&#x2F;csgobetting subreddit warning users of a CSGO wagering bot called “CSGOBetting.” The poster included an image of the wagering bot’s website and a screenshot of their CSGO betting history, which showed that they had placed a series of high-value bets on a match involving the team Natus Vincere (NaVi) against the team North.</p>
<p>The NaVi vs North matchup took place on September 30th, 2018, and was part of the DreamHack Open Denver tournament. NaVi was the heavy favorite going into the match, with North being seen as a significant underdog. As such, most casual bettors would not have placed any bets on this matchup. However, &#x2F;u&#x2F;xqcow’s screenshot shows that they had wagered over $1,000 on NaVi to win - a bet that would have resulted in a significant loss if North had won.</p>
<p>After seeing this post, other Reddit users quickly began posting their own experiences with CSGOBetting. Many reported similar stories of placing high-value bets on matches that they had no chance of winning. In some cases, these bets resulted in losses of hundreds or even thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>As news of this wagering bot spread, players began to wonder how it was possible for such a thing to exist without Microgaming (the company that provides gaming software for CSGO) taking any action against it. Given that Microgaming has a strict policy against bots and cheats in their games, it was unclear how CSGOBetting was able to operate for so long without being shut down.</p>
<p>Fortunately, on October 3rd - just one day after xqcow’s initial post - Microgaming tweeted out a message announcing that they had identified and removed the CSGOBetting bot from their platform. This announcement was welcomed by the community and confirmed thatMicrogaming is taking measures to ensure that bots like CSGOBetting are not allowed to operate on their platform.</p>
<h1 id="How-Do-I-Report-A-CSGO-Wagering-Bot-To-Microgaming"><a href="#How-Do-I-Report-A-CSGO-Wagering-Bot-To-Microgaming" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Report A CSGO Wagering Bot To Microgaming?"></a>How Do I Report A CSGO Wagering Bot To Microgaming?</h1><p>The first step is to gather evidence of the bot’s activity. This includes screenshots of the bot’s bets, chat logs showing conversations with the bot, and any other evidence you can find.</p>
<p>Next, contact Microgaming’s [email protected] email address. Provide them with as much information as you can, including the evidence you’ve gathered.</p>
<p>Microgaming will investigate the matter and take appropriate action.</p>
