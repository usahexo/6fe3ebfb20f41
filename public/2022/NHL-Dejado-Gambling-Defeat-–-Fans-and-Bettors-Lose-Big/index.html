        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="NHL-Dejado-Gambling-Defeat-–-Fans-and-Bettors-Lose-Big"><a href="#NHL-Dejado-Gambling-Defeat-–-Fans-and-Bettors-Lose-Big" class="headerlink" title="NHL Dejado Gambling Defeat – Fans and Bettors Lose Big"></a>NHL Dejado Gambling Defeat – Fans and Bettors Lose Big</h1><p>The NHL Dejado gambling debacle is a textbook example of how NOT to run a sportsbook.</p>
<p>On September 8, 2017, the Tampa Bay Lightning hosted the Detroit Red Wings in an exhibition game. The odds on the game were posted on the website of Dejado, a Costa Rican-based sportsbook.</p>
<p>The Lightning were a huge favorite, with a listed odds of -500 (meaning you would have to bet $500 to win $100). The Red Wings were given +350 odds (meaning you would win $350 if you bet $100).</p>
<p>Dejado took lots of bets on the game, but when the final score was announced, it was clear that they had made a big mistake. The Lightning had only won by one goal, meaning that all of the bets on Tampa Bay were losers.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the only bad news for Dejado customers. Because the Red Wings had been given such long odds, anyone who had bet on Detroit won big. In fact, some people betting on Detroit won more than 1000 times their original investment!</p>
<p>This debacle has led to angry fans and lost money for bettors. It’s also another black eye for the already scandal-plagued online gambling industry.</p>
<h1 id="NHL-Gambling-Defeated-as-Bettors-Rejoice"><a href="#NHL-Gambling-Defeated-as-Bettors-Rejoice" class="headerlink" title="NHL Gambling Defeated as Bettors Rejoice"></a>NHL Gambling Defeated as Bettors Rejoice</h1><p>The National Hockey League (NHL) announced Tuesday that it would prohibit gambling on its games, effective immediately.</p>
<p>This decision comes as a surprise to many in the sports industry, as the NHL has been one of the most lenient leagues when it comes to gambling. In fact, the NHL was one of the few leagues that allowed wagers on game outcomes to be placed both in-person and online.</p>
<p>The NHL’s new policy prohibits all types of gambling on its games, including pre-game and in-game bets, prop bets, and parlays involving NHL games.</p>
<p>The ban is a major victory for those who have been lobbying for stricter regulations on sports betting, including the NFL and NBA. Both leagues have been outspoken opponents of legalized sports betting, arguing that it could lead to match-fixing and other corruption within their sports.</p>
<p>In a statement announcing the ban, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said:</p>
<p>“The integrity of our sport is paramount and we are committed to protecting it. This new policy will ensure that our fans can enjoy our games without the influence of illegal gambling.”</p>
<p>Many Bettors React with Disbelief</p>
<p>The reaction from bettors was mixed, with some expressing disbelief at the news while others said they were happy to see the league take such a strong stance against gambling.</p>
<p>One bettor named John told Bleacher Report he had lost thousands of dollars betting on NHL games and was relieved to hear about the ban. “I don’t understand why this took so long,” he said. “It’s about time they did something to protect us consumers.”</p>
<h1 id="NHL-Gambling-Stopped-in-its-Tracks"><a href="#NHL-Gambling-Stopped-in-its-Tracks" class="headerlink" title="NHL Gambling Stopped in its Tracks"></a>NHL Gambling Stopped in its Tracks</h1><p>After a full year of NHL gambling, the league has come to a screeching halt. The unexpected turn of events happened when it was revealed that many teams had been purposely tanking in order to win the top pick in the draft. Bettors who had placed money on these games were out thousands of dollars, and the subsequent legal proceedings have put a stop to all types of NHL gambling.</p>
<p>It is unknown when this fiasco will be sorted out, but for now, there is no way to legally bet on NHL games. This leaves bettors at a loss, as there are very few other sports that offer the same excitement and potential payouts as betting on hockey does.</p>
<p>All is not lost, however, as there are still ways to make profits betting on hockey. There are plenty of other sports out there that are just as exciting to bet on, and they offer just as much potential profit. So while NHL gambling is currently off the table, there are still plenty of opportunities to make some money when it comes to betting on sports.</p>
<h1 id="NHL-Dejado-Gambling-Fails-as-Bettors-Win"><a href="#NHL-Dejado-Gambling-Fails-as-Bettors-Win" class="headerlink" title="NHL Dejado Gambling Fails as Bettors Win"></a>NHL Dejado Gambling Fails as Bettors Win</h1><p>While the National Hockey League (NHL) has always had a large and passionate following, the recent gambling scandals have put a blemish on the league. In this article, we take a look at the latest headlines and analyze how betting scandals have taken center stage in the NHL.</p>
<p>The NHL has been shrouded in gambling scandals for years now, with many fans questioning the league’s integrity. In March of this year, it was revealed that Boston Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs had been tied to offshore sports betting operations. Jacobs is said to have made over $500,000 in profits from illegal bets placed on NHL games. This revelation came just one week after former head of officiating for the NHL, Brian Murphy, admitted to taking bribes from a gambling syndicate in exchange for inside information on games.</p>
<p>These latest revelations are just the latest in a long line of gambling scandals to plague the NHL. In 2007, it was revealed that then-New Jersey Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello had placed more than $200,000 worth of illegal bets on NHL games. One of Lamoriello’s players at the time, Petr Sykora, was also caught up in the scandal after placing bets on games involving his own team. Sykora was subsequently banned from playing in the NHL for two years.</p>
<p>In 2011, Philadelphia Flyers general manager Paul Holmgren and assistant coach Craig Berube were both fined by the league after being caught placing shady bets on games. Then, in 2012, Chicago Blackhawks head coach Joel Quenneville was fined $10,000 after being caught betting on his own team’s games. As you can see, gambling scandals have become all too common in the NHL over the past decade or so.</p>
<p>So why do these scandals keep happening? And why does the NHL seem unable to shake its association with gambling? A big part of the problem is that hockey is a fast-paced game that lends itself well to betting lines and odds. Bettors can make easy money by accurately predicting outcomes of games based on previous performances and matchups. This makes hockey an attractive proposition for unscrupulous bookmakers and bettors alike.</p>
<p>Another reason for all these scandals may be that the NHL doesn’t take gambling seriously enough. While other professional sports leagues have dedicated departments tasked with policing illegal betting activity, the NHL does not have anything similar in place. This likely means that there is less scrutiny applied to AHL games than there should be, making it easier for nefarious characters to place illegal bets without getting caught.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons may be, it is clear that hockey has a serious gambling problem that is unlikely to go away any time soon. The league needs to take a closer look at its policies and procedures regarding gambling and make sure that everyone involved is held accountable when misdemeanors occur. Only then will the NHL be able to move past its embarrassing gambling scandals and focus on what really matters – putting on a good show for its fans!</p>
<h1 id="NHL-Gambling-Banned-Bettors-rejoice-while-fans-mourn"><a href="#NHL-Gambling-Banned-Bettors-rejoice-while-fans-mourn" class="headerlink" title="NHL Gambling Banned: Bettors rejoice while fans mourn"></a>NHL Gambling Banned: Bettors rejoice while fans mourn</h1><p>The NHL has long been one of the most popular sports in the United States and Canada, but starting this year it may become much more popular in Europe. That’s because starting this season, NHL gambling will be banned in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>This has led to a lot of happiness among European sportsbooks, as they expect a huge influx of bets on NHL games. For example, Bet365 has already seen an increase in betting interest on NHL games, with over 80 percent of all bets being placed on hockey markets outside of North America.</p>
<p>Fans of the NHL, however, are not so pleased with the news. They argue that it takes away some of the excitement and spontaneity of watching a game when you know that the outcome has already been predetermined by a bet.</p>
<p>Others worry that eliminating gambling on NHL games will lead to a decrease in viewership and betting interest in the sport overall. This could have a significant impact on the NHL’s bottom line, as television contracts and other sources of revenue are likely to take a hit.</p>
<p>At this point it’s too early to tell how things will play out, but it will be interesting to see if fans continue to watch and bet on NHL games even knowing that they can’t win or lose money on them.</p>
