# The Legal Gambling Age in the United States

The legal gambling age in the United States varies from state to state. There are currently only two states that have a gambling age of 21 – Hawaii and Utah. The majority of states allow 18-year-olds to gamble, while a number of states allow those 16 and over to gamble. A few states have no specified gambling age, leaving it up to the proprietor of the gambling establishment to set their own minimum age requirement.

The following map displays the legal gambling age for each state in the U.S.A.

#  Get Ready to Gamble at 18: These States are Making it Legal

While the age of 18 may seem young, more and more states are legalizing gambling at that age. So, if you’re 18 and itching to gamble, where can you go?

The short answer is: just about everywhere. In the United States, there are no federal laws against gambling at 18. Each state sets its own rules, so you’ll want to check your state’s regulations.

But generally speaking, most states allow gambling at 18 for activities like playing the lottery, betting on sports, or playing casino games in a licensed venue. There may be some restrictions on which games you can play or how much you can bet. And in some cases, you may need to be 21 to gamble in a casino.

So if you’re ready to take your gambling game up a notch, here are five states where you can do it at 18.

1. Nevada

If you want to party like a rockstar and gamble like a pro, head to Nevada. Gambling has been legal in Nevada since 1931 and the state offers some of the most liberal gambling laws in the country. You can gamble at 18 on just about any game in any licensed venue, including casinos, race tracks and Indian reservations. The only exception is Category 3 gaming machines (which include poker), which are restricted to players aged 21 and over.

2. New Jersey

In 2013, New Jersey became the third state in the US to legalize online gambling for people aged 18 and older. This means that residents of The Garden State can enjoy all sorts of online gambling activities from the comfort of their own home – including poker, blackjack, roulette and slots – at 18 years old or older! And if you prefer live action, New Jersey also has 13 land-based casinos where you can try your luck at 18 years old. Just be sure to check your state’s regulations before heading out to play – some casinos have higher age limits than others.

3. Delaware

Delaware was one of the early adopters of casino gambling in the US and it was one of the first states to legalize gambling at 18 years old. Today, Delaware offers 6 different types of casino games that can be enjoyed by players aged 18 and older: slot machines, video gaming devices (VGTs), table games (including blackjack and roulette), craps, baccarat and Pai Gow Poker). Minimum betting limits vary by game but start as low as $0.10 cents per bet for slots and VGTs. So whether you’re a seasoned gambler or new to the scene, Delaware has something for everyone!

4. Pennsylvania

Pennsylvania is another great option for those looking to gamble at 18 years old – especially if you’re looking for variety! The Keystone State offers 11 categories of legal gambling activities including: horseracing; greyhound racing; pari-mutuel wagering on jai alai; slots; table games (including blackjack, craps and roulette); poker; bingo; lotteries; charitable gaming; social gaming (playing with friends for fun) and skill-based amusements (like carnival games). Just note that there may be different age limits depending on which activity you choose – so be sure to check Pennsylvania’s regulations before heading out to gamble!

#  In These States, Gambling will be Legal at 18 Years Old

In the United States, gambling will now be legal for those aged 18 years or older in these states: Delaware, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey and Rhode Island. This change came about because of the Supreme Court’s recent ruling to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992.

The professional and amateur sports protection act was a law that essentially banned sports betting with some exceptions. PASPA was challenged in court by New Jersey, and after many twists and turns, the Supreme Court sided with New Jersey in a 6-3 decision. This allows each individual state to decide if they want to legalize gambling within their borders and at what age it should be legal.

While this may seem like a win for those who enjoy gambling, there are many who disagree with this decision. Some worry that it will lead to addiction problems and other negative consequences for those involved. Others argue that this simply gives people another opportunity to spend their money and that it won’t have a significant impact on society overall.

Only time will tell how this change will play out across the country. In the meantime, those who are interested in gambling can head to one of the states where it is now legal to do so.
