#  Aquila Basket Trento on the Rise

After a disappointing 2016-2017 season, Aquila Basket Trento has turned things around in a big way. Led by head coach Paolo Buscaglia, the squad is now in first place in the Italian Serie A standings and is looking like a contender for the championship.

The turnaround can be attributed to several factors. First and foremost, the team has been very well-balanced, with no player averaging more than 15 points per game. This balanced attack has been spearheaded by American stars David White and Tony Gaffney, who are both averaging over 12 points per contest.

In addition, the team has been playing extremely well defensively, allowing just 92.8 points per game (second best in Serie A). This stout defense is anchored by veteran center Giacomo Solfrini, who is averaging 2.4 blocks per game.

Finally, the team has been extremely consistent, losing only four games all season. This consistency has been especially important in the playoffs, where they have already dispatched of two higher-seeded teams en route to the Finals.

If Aquila Basket Trento can continue to play at this high level, they have a very good chance of winning their first championship in club history.

#  Aquila Basket Trento Wins Again

* A team that keeps on winning

The Aquila Basket Trento is a team that knows how to win. They have been proving this since the beginning of the season. And they continue to do so, even now, in the playoffs. This past weekend, they played against Pallacanestro Varese and won by a score of 92-77. This makes it their sixth consecutive victory.

* Dominant play

What is most impressive about this teamâ€™s recent victories is the way they have achieved them. They have been playing very dominantly, scoring lots of points while allowing few to their opponents. This was especially evident in the game against Pallacanestro Varese. Aquila Basket Trento managed to score 92 points while their opponents could only muster up 77. That is a 15-point difference!

* The playoffs begin

Now that the playoffs have begun, Aquila Basket Trento will be looking to keep their winning streak alive. They have been drawn in a group with Virtus Bologna and Umbertide, both teams that they should be able to beat. However, they cannot take any of these games lightly, as anything can happen in the playoffs. If they want to make it all the way to the championship game, they will need to continue playing at this high level.

For the first time in club history, Aquila Basket Trento have clinched a berth in the playoffs of the Italian top-tier basketball league, Serie A. The Eagles, as they are nicknamed, finished the regular season in seventh place with a record of 19 wins and 15 losses. 

"It's an incredible feeling," head coach Maurizio Buscaglia said after the final game. "I'm very happy for all of our fans and for the entire city."
