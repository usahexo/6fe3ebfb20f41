#  Bursaspor Odds to Win Turkish Cup

Bursaspor is at +300 odds to win the Turkish Cup, which would be their first major trophy in club history. They reached the final after topping their group and beating rivals Galatasaray and Fenerbahce in the knockout stages. Bursaspor will face Basaksehir in the final, who are at -450 odds to win.

Basaksehir have been one of the best teams in Turkey this season, but they will have their hands full with Bursaspor. The final will be played at Ataturk Olympic Stadium on May 26th.

#  Bursaspor Betting Preview

The Turkish Super Lig resumes this weekend following the international break, with Bursaspor hosting reigning champions Besiktas. It’s a tough game to call, but we’re going to have a go at predicting the outcome.

Bursaspor are 14th in the table with just four points from their first six games, so they need a win here if they are to have any hope of avoiding relegation. They were poor defensively in their last league game, conceding three times in a 3-1 home defeat to Goztepe.

Besiktas are top of the table with 17 points from their first six games, and they will be confident of picking up all three points here. They’ve been impressive on their travels so far this season, winning four of their five away games.

Based on these form guides, it looks like Besiktas will narrowly edge this one. We’re predicting a 2-1 victory for the Black Eagles.

#  Europa League: Bursaspor vs Genk

The Europa League match played between Bursaspor and Genk was an intense and entertaining one. The first half produced a few goal-scoring chances for both sides, but neither team was able to take the lead. The second half was much more exciting, with both teams scoring goals within the first 10 minutes. Bursaspor took the lead in the 58th minute when Gustavo Gomez headed in a perfect cross from Volkan Sen. However, Genk equalized just two minutes later when Kalifa Coulibaly scored after some good work by Omar Fofana on the wing.

The final 10 minutes of the match were very exciting, with both teams pushing for the winning goal. Unfortunately for Bursaspor, they were not able to find a winner and the match finished in a 2-2 draw. This result means that Bursaspor have now lost their chance of qualifying for the next round of the Europa League.

#  Bundesliga: Augsburg vs Bursaspor

Previewing the upcoming matchup between Augsburg and Bursaspor in the Bundesliga.

Augsburg comes into this matchup as the slight favorites, but Bursaspor are no slouches. Augsburg will likely be looking to use their home field advantage to get a win here, but Bursaspor cannot be underestimated.

Augsburg has had a somewhat inconsistent season so far. They started off the season poorly, but have since turned things around and are now on a three-game winning streak. However, they have not been particularly impressive in any of their wins. Their last two matches were both 1-0 victories, with neither match being particularly exciting or well played by Augsburg.

Bursaspor, on the other hand, started the season off very poorly but have since turned things around. They are currently on a five-match unbeaten streak, with their latest victory being a 3-1 win over Werder Bremen. This is definitely an impressive run of form, but it is worth noting that four of those five matches were draws before they finally got their first win. It will be interesting to see if they can keep up their good form against a strong Augsburg side.

One player to watch in this match will be Alfred Finnbogason for Augsburg. He has been in excellent form this season, scoring six goals in eleven appearances so far. If Bursaspor want to stand a chance of winning, they will need to keep him quiet.

Prediction: Augsburg 2-1 Bursaspor
