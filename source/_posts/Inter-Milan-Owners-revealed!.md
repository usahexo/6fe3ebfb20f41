“Suning Holdings Group has always loved football and has been committed to bringing advanced football culture from Europe to China and providing professional service to domestic football clubs and players,” Zhang Jindong said in a statement.

“Inter Milan is not only an iconic European football club with great history but also has an excellent squad with brilliant young players. We are happy that we can continue to work with Erick Thohir and his team to make Inter Milan become one of the best clubs in the world again.”

The Kroenke family, who also own the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League and Arsenal of the English Premier League, among other sports franchises, made the announcement on Tuesday.

"Inter Milan is one of the most iconic clubs in world soccer," Stan Kroenke said in a statement. "It has a proud history and we are honored to be a part of it."

The deal is subject to approval by Inter Milan's shareholders and regulatory authorities.

According to media reports, the price tag for Inter Milan is about $900 million. The deal would include both the club and its 70,000-seat stadium, San Siro.

The Kroenkes become just the latest American owners of a European soccer club. The Ricketts family owns Liverpool FC, John Henry owns Liverpool's biggest rival, Everton FC, and Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert has a minority ownership stake in Spanish side Atletico Madrid.

The Kroenkes have long been interested in buying a European soccer club. In 2016, they came close to purchasing British side Derby County before losing out to an investment group led by Chinese businesswoman Carol Cheng.

Inter Milan is one of Italy's most successful clubs, having won 18 Serie A titles, seven Coppa Italias and three UEFA Cups/Europa Leagues. But the club has fallen on hard times recently, finishing 7th in Serie A last season which resulted in them failing to qualify for any European competition this year.

"We are excited to work with the team's current management to return Inter Milan to the top of Italian football and build on its international success."

The Steinbrenners have been involved in professional sports for many years. They own the New York Yankees baseball team as well as London's successful Premier League soccer club, West Ham United.

Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has announced he is the new owner of Inter Milan.

The Russian billionaire bought the Serie A club from Indonesian businessman Erick Thohir for an undisclosed fee.

"I am excited to be the new owner of Inter Milan," said Abramovich. "This is a great club with a fantastic history. I am confident we can achieve great things together."

#  Inter Milan sold to group of American businessmen

Italian football club Inter Milan announced on Thursday that it has been sold to a group of American businessmen. According to the team, the new owners will be “dedicated to returning Inter to its former glory while maintaining its Serie A status.”

The deal is said to be worth around €740 million ($815 million), making it one of the most expensive transfers of a football club in history. The buyers are a consortium led by Zhang Jindong, the chairman of Suning Holdings Group, which owns China’s largest online retailer.

Inter Milan is one of the most successful clubs in Italian football, having won 18 league titles and three European Cup/Champions League trophies. However, they have not won any major trophies since 2010 and have been struggling in recent years both on and off the pitch.

Under the new ownership, Inter Milan fans can expect a significant investment in the team with a view to returning them to the top of Italian and European football. This is good news for Serie A as a whole, which has been struggling in recent years with declining viewership and falling sponsorship revenues. With one of its biggest clubs back at the top of its game, Serie A should see a resurgence in popularity both domestically and internationally.
