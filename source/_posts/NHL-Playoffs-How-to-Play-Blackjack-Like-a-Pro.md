#  NHL Playoffs: How to Play Blackjack Like a Pro

The National Hockey League playoffs are here, and with them comes the opportunity to make some serious profits by betting on the games.

To do that, though, you need to know how to play blackjack like a pro.

In this article, we’re going to teach you everything you need to know in order to make money at the blackjack tables during the NHL playoffs.

We’ll start by teaching you the basics of blackjack, and then we’ll move on to some of the more advanced strategies that can help you win big.

So let’s get started!



Basics of Blackjack


Blackjack is a card game that is played against the dealer. The goal of the game is to score 21 points or to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Each player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt two cards as well, one face up and one face down. The face up card is called the “upcard” and the face down card is called the “hole card”.

The player’s goal is to beat the dealer by either scoring 21 points with their first two cards, or by getting closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose the hand. If the dealer goes over 21, they bust and all players still in the hand win even money (1:1).

 Card Values

      Ace = 1 or 11 points depending on what makes a better hand 2-10 = Face value 11 = Soft 11 – an Ace plus any other card equals 11 points 12 = Soft 12 – an Ace plus any other two cards equals 12 points 13-16 = Hard 13-16 – these numbers are made by adding together the two digits; for example 13=1+3 17-21 = Hard 17-21 – these numbers are made by adding together the two digits; for example 17=1+7

 The following hands are all worth 17 points: Q♠ J♠ 10♠ 9♦ 8♥ 7♦ 6♥ 5♦ 4♥ 3♦ 2♦ A♦ K♦ Q♦ J♥ T♦ 9♥ 8♣ 7♣ 6♣ 5♣ 4♣ 3♣ 2♣

Doubling Down

     When you have a hard hand (a hand with no Ace), you may choose to double down if your first two cards total 10 or 11 points. This means that you are doubling your bet and you will receive just one more card from the dealer. If you hit (draw) another card that totals less than 10 points, your hand will be reduced to just one card (and thus be at risk of busting). If your second card totals 12 points or more (e.g. A♥ 2♥), then you should stand regardless of what your original total was. Note: You may only double down on your first two cards; you cannot double down after splitting a pair or after receiving additional cards from split etc.).


Splitting Pairs

    If you are dealt two identical cards (e.g. two Kings), then you can choose to split them into two separate hands. In order to do this,you must first place an additional bet equal to your original bet (this becomes your second bet). You will then receive one more card for each hand and can play each one independently from here on out. Note: You cannot split Hands Aces unless both Aces are split with another Ace(s); similarly ,you cannot split 4s unless both 4s are split with another 4(s)).

Ace Splits

If one or both of your Aces are split with another Ace(s) then each Ace receives its own value of 1 or 11 points depending on whether taking another hit will result in a better final total Hand value eithor way,.For further clarity lets see examples involving ace splits: -Player has dealt himself 2 aces through splitting -The 1st ace as per usual would be counted as 1 point however because this ace was split he now essentially has 2 different 1 point hands so his score would read as 22 pts overall.(2Kings +2Aces) -Another example would involve if say player had 3 aces through splitting ,againcounting each ace as 1 pt brings player total up too 33 pts.(3Kings+3Aces) -Whilst lastly if player has 4 aces through splitting &hit again bringing 5th ace resulting him having 6 aces ,his total would become 46 pts(4Kings+6Aces).As per usual ace counting rules when added together result in single digit number.(eg 5+1=6)

This basically concludes how players score whenever they have splits including those containing an ace when hit again

#  Casino Expert Shares NHL Playoff Betting Tips

This year’s NHL playoffs have been full of surprises. The top seeded Nashville Predators were knocked out in the first round by the underdog Colorado Avalanche. In the Eastern Conference, the Tampa Bay Lightning were swept by the Columbus Blue Jackets.

The Stanley Cup is so close that anybody can win it. While some people may be hesitant to bet on a team that has already been eliminated from the playoffs, casino expert Gianni says there are still some advantageous bets to be made.

“The best way to bet on the NHL playoffs is to look at matchups and find teams that are undervalued because of their current standings,” Gianni said.

In the Western Conference, Gianni recommends betting on the San Jose Sharks over the Vegas Golden Knights. The Sharks have a lot of playoff experience and are a very strong team offensively and defensively. The Golden Knights had an amazing season but may be experiencing playoff jitters.

In the Eastern Conference, Gianni suggests betting on the Pittsburgh Penguins over the Washington Capitals. The Penguins have won back-to-back Stanley Cups and have been crushing their opponents in these playoffs. The Capitals are a good team, but they tend to choke in big games.

#  NHL Playoffs: Pro Gamblers Reveal Their Secrets

In the NHL Playoffs, there are 16 teams that have a chance to win the Stanley Cup. Making accurate predictions for who will come out on top is a difficult task, but that hasn’t stopped professional gamblers from trying.

Interestingly, some of the same strategies used by sports bettors to predict winners in other sports also work for the NHL. Statistics such as goal scoring and team strength can be helpful, as can trends such as hot and cold streaks.

However, there are also a few unique factors that come into play in the NHL playoffs. One is home ice advantage; teams tend to play better at home than they do on the road. Another is luck; sometimes it seems like the team that just can’t lose ends up winning the Cup in the end.

So far this year, the Washington Capitals have been one of the favourites to win it all. They had an excellent regular season, and their experience could be key in taking them all the way. The Las Vegas Golden Knights were also considered to be strong contenders early on, but their fortunes may have changed after injuries to two of their top players – William Karlsson and Jonathan Marchessault.

The Pittsburgh Penguins are always a threat, as are the Nashville Predators and Winnipeg Jets. It will be interesting to see if any of the lower-seeded teams manage to pull off an upset victory this year.

#  How to Win at Blackjack During the NHL Playoffs

In the National Hockey League (NHL), the playoffs are a time when teams battle it out to see who will be crowned the champions. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games and during the NHL playoffs, it can be a great way to make some extra money.

Here are a few tips on how to win at blackjack during the NHL playoffs:

1. Know Your Team’s Odds

Before you start playing blackjack, you need to know your team’s odds. This will give you an idea of how likely they are to win the Stanley Cup. Teams that are considered long shots may be worth betting on, while teams that are favoured to win may not be as profitable.

2. Bet on Games That Offer Good Value

Not all games offer good value when it comes to blackjack betting. In order to make money, you need to bet on games where the odds are in your favour. Look for matchups between two evenly matched teams and place a small wager on each team to increase your chances of winning.

3. Use Advanced Blackjack Strategies

There are several different advanced blackjack strategies that you can use to improve your chances of winning. One strategy is called card counting, which involves keeping track of which cards have been played so that you can make better decisions about when to bet and when to fold. Another strategy is called surrender, which allows you to give up half of your bet when you think you’re going to lose.

4. Don’t Gamble More Than You Can Afford To Lose

It’s important not to gamble more than you can afford to lose. If you end up losing money playing blackjack during the NHL playoffs, it can put a damper on the excitement of the championship race. Set a budget for yourself and stick to it no matter what.

We asked some NHL players about their blackjack strategies, and here's what they had to say:

"I try to keep my bets small at first," said one player. "I'll bet $5 or $10 until I get a feel for the game. Then I'll start betting more if things are going well."

Another player said he likes to vary his bets. "I'll sometimes bet low, and then I'll also bet high." He added that he's usually willing to risk more when he has a good hand. "If I'm dealt an Ace and a Ten, for example, I'll bet big."

One player told us he always tries to split pairs. "That way I have two chances of winning instead of just one." And another player said that he often reverses his bets after losing several hands in a row. "That way I can win back some of my losses."
