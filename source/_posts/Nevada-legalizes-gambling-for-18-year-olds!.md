#  Nevada legalizes gambling for 18-year-olds!

In a unanimous vote, the Nevada State Assembly passed a bill legalizing gambling for 18-year-olds. The new law will go into effect on January 1, 2019.

“This is great news for Nevada’s economy, and especially for our young people,” said Assemblyman Ira Hansen. “It will give them opportunities to learn responsible gambling behavior and to participate in this important part of our state’s culture.”

Nevada is the only state in the country with no minimum age requirement for gambling. Supporters of the new law say that it will help keep young people away from illegal gambling operations and underground casinos.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to addiction and other negative consequences for young people. They point to studies which show that the average age of problem gamblers is just 34 years old.

Despite these concerns, the passage of this bill shows that Nevada is committed to expanding gambling opportunities for its citizens.

#  New Hampshire becomes next state to legalize gambling for people aged 18 and up!

After months of heated debate and several failed attempts, the New Hampshire state legislature finally passed a bill legalizing gambling for people aged 18 and up. The new law will go into effect on July 1st, making New Hampshire the fifth US state to legalize gambling for all adults.

Supporters of the bill argue that it will help generate much-needed revenue for the state government, while opponents claim that it will lead to increased crime and addiction rates. Democratic Governor John Lynch has not yet said whether he will sign the bill into law.

New Hampshire is home to two land-based casinos – Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard and Twin River Casino in Lincoln – as well as a number of racetracks that offer video slot machines. Under the new law, those establishments will be able to offer more types of gambling, including blackjack, roulette, and craps.

The legalization of gambling in New Hampshire follows a trend that began in Nevada in 1931. Since then, four other states – Delaware, Montana, Oregon, and Puerto Rico – have followed suit. Casino gambling is currently legal in 30 US states and Washington, DC.

#  Pennsylvania finally lifts its gambling age to 18! 

After years of debate and lobbying from both sides, Pennsylvania has finally lifted its gambling age to 18! This is great news for Pennsylvanians who have been eagerly waiting for this change, as well as for the casinos and racetracks who will now be able to offer their products to a larger audience.

Pennsylvania is the latest state to join the growing number of states that have lowered their gambling age in recent years. This trend has been spurred by research that shows that young adults are able to make reasoned decisions about gambling, and that prohibiting them from participating in legal forms of gambling only results in them engaging in illegal forms of gambling instead.

This change is also good news for the casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years thanks to the proliferation of online casino games. By allowing people aged 18 and over to gamble at casinos, racetracks, and other venues, Pennsylvania is giving its casinos a chance to compete with the online gaming industry.

There are some who worry that lowering the gambling age will lead to more problem gamblers, but the evidence suggests that this is not the case. In fact, studies show that most people start gambling at an early age without developing any problems. It is only when people start gambling at a young age and continue to gamble problematically into adulthood that they are more likely to develop a gambling addiction.

So while there is always a risk of problem gambling when it comes to any type of gambling, it appears that allowing people aged 18 and over to gamble is a safer option than forcing them to engage in illegal activities.

#  Iowa now allows gambling at the ripe age of 18!

In a unanimous decision on May 2, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission voted to allow gambling at the age of 18. This makes Iowa the fourth state in the US to allow gambling at 18, after Delaware, Montana, and New Jersey.

The Commission's Chair, Keith Kizer, had this to say: "After reviewing all of the information available to us, the Commission unanimously voted to align Iowa's gambling age with that of our neighboring states."

This is great news for anyone who loves to gamble! Now you can make those trips to Vegas or Atlantic City a bit sooner. Just be sure to bring your ID!

#  Gambling is now legal for persons aged 18 and up in Wyoming!

After a long wait, the people of Wyoming have finally been granted the right to gamble. This comes after a statewide referendum in which over 60% of residents voted in favor of legalizing gambling. The referendum allows casinos, both on and off-track betting, and fantasy sports.

Gambling has always been a controversial topic, but with this latest development, it’s clear that Wyoming is moving forward. The benefits of legalized gambling are many; it will create jobs, generate revenue for the state, and help to support local businesses.

Critics of gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. However, with sensible regulation and responsible play, these risks can be minimized. Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, and now that it’s legal in Wyoming, everyone can enjoy it!
