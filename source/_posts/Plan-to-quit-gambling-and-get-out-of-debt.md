#  Plan to quit gambling and get out of debt

Are you struggling with a gambling addiction and mounting debt? You're not alone. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, over 2 million people in the United States are addicted to gambling. If you're ready to take control of your life and break free from your addiction, follow these simple steps:

1. Admit that you have a problem and need help.

The first step to getting out of debt is admitting that you have a problem. Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can wreck your life if left untreated. Don't be afraid to ask for help from friends, family members, or a professional therapist.

2. Make a plan to quit gambling.

Quitting gambling isn't easy, but it's possible if you have a solid plan in place. Decide what specific actions you will take to avoid gambling and stick to them. For example, you might decide to avoid casinos, online betting websites, and lotteries altogether. You might also want to delete all of your gambling-related apps from your phone or tablet.

3. Get rid of any temptation.

If possible, get rid of any objects or items that might tempt you to gamble. This includes money, lottery tickets, casino chips, and even pictures of casinos or betting websites. If you can't get rid of the temptation entirely, at least try to keep them out of sight and out of mind.

4. Reach out for support from others who have struggled with gambling addictions.

There are many online forums and support groups for people struggling with gambling addictions. These groups can offer invaluable support and advice as you work through your addiction. You can also find helpful resources on the National Council on Problem Gambling website .

#  How to make a plan to quit gambling and get out of debt

Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time but it can also quickly become an addiction that causes debt and financial ruin. If you’re struggling with a gambling addiction, it’s important to take steps to get out of the cycle of debt and misery.

The first step is to make a plan. This plan should include:

-How much money you will allow yourself to spend on gambling each week/month

-What activities you will do instead of gambling (e.g. read, go for walks, etc.)

-How you will save money each week/month to put towards getting out of debt

-What goals you have for getting out of debt (e.g. paying off credit cards, saving for a down payment on a house, etc.)

-Who you will talk to about your gambling addiction and how they can help (e.g. family members, friends, therapist, etc.)

It’s important to be honest with yourself about how much money you are willing to spend on gambling each week/month. Don’t set unrealistic limits for yourself that will only lead to frustration and failure. Be honest about the amount of money you need to save each week/month in order to reach your goals as well. This may require some lifestyle changes but it’s important to remember that these changes are temporary and will help you get back on track financially.

Making a plan is the first step but it’s also important to put this plan into action. Start by cutting back on the amount of money you gamble each week/month. This may mean skipping your regular poker game or betting race horses only once a week instead of every day. It’s also important to find activities that don’t involve spending money such as going for walks, reading, watching movies, etc. These activities can help keep your mind occupied without costing you any money.

Finally, start saving money each week/month towards getting out of debt. It may be tough at first but if you stick to your plan it will definitely pay off in the long run! Make sure you celebrate every milestone along the way even if it’s something small such as paying off one credit card bill or saving $100 towards your goal. Having goals and celebrating milestones will help keep you motivated during this difficult process. Talk to family members and friends about your gambling addiction and ask them for support along the way – they may be able to provide helpful advice or just moral support when things get tough!

4. Take breaks from gambling

If you find yourself struggling to control your gambling habits, take breaks from gambling altogether. Don't gamble for a certain period of time - a week, a month, or even longer if necessary. This will give you time to reassess your situation and hopefully help curb any addictive tendencies.

5. Set goals and reward yourself along the way

When quitting anything - including gambling - it's helpful to set small goals and reward yourself for reaching them. This will keep you motivated and encouraged throughout the process. For example, once you've managed not to gamble for an entire month, treat yourself to something special like a new book or dinner out with friends.
